1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client side routing allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates.  It loads slower, but performs faster.  Server side routing is better for SEO, but refreshes the page every time you navigate.  It loads faster because it only loads one page at a time, but performs slower for the same reason.
